      <t>
        When the ICE (RFC 5245) and TURN (RFC 5766) is used in a
        endpoint as a firewall/NAT traversal mechanism the TURN relay
        can also be used to measure bandwidth and latency prior to
        call setup.
      </t>
      <t>
        In normal ICE behavior the client first send a message
        (allocate request) to the TURN server to allocate a RELAY
        address. This address can be used by the endpoint to receive
        media from other endpoints. The media stream is then received
        by the TURN server and then relayed back to the endpoint
        behind the fw/NAT. For security reasons the endpoint must
        first set the correct permissions on the TURN server to only
        allow media from remote participants he wants to talk to
        (Addresses taken from the SIP SDP offer/answer exhange) . The
        endpoint will also learn it RFLX address on the fw/NAT when
        talking to the TURN server.

        The agent allocates a TURN Relay port on its designated TURN
        server as described in RFC XXX. In the process the agent will
        alos learn the outmost NAT address. This is called the
        reflexive address. For more information se the section
        regarding candidate discovery in ICE RFCZZZ. 
      </t>
      <t>
        The agent must set the permissions on the allocated realay
        port as describen in TURN RFCYYY section xx, to allow traffic
        from the discovered RFLX adress.  
      </t>
      <t>
        Send packets to the allocated Relay port on the TURN
        server. The packets will be forarded back to the agent in a
        data inidication pacaket- Se TURN RFCXXX sectionYY for details
        on how the ternserver can relay packets back to the allocating
        agent. Available availble bandwith can be measured by sending
        varioyng amounts of packet and detecting packet loss. Each
        packet sent will be affecting bout upstream and downstream link
      </t>
      <t>
        4. Create Special payload packets with timestamp and send them
        from the endpoint to the RELAY port on the TURN server.
        
        5. Special payload packets arrive at TURN server on the RELAY
        port and will be sent back to endpoint on the TURN tunnel
        opened up by the initial allocate request.
        
        6 Special payload packets arrive at endpoint. Bandwith and
        latency can now be measured by using the timestamp in the
        packets. (Latency can be a bit problematic as we don?t know if
        inbound or outbound differ. But divide by 2 and the number
        will be fairly accurate)
